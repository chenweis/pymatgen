Overview
========

This page provides new users of the pymatgen code base with a quick overview of the pymatgen code base.

Pymatgen is structured in a highly object-oriented manner. Almost everything (Element, Site, Structure, etc.) is an object.  Currently, the code is heavily
biased towards the representation and manipulation of crystals with periodic boundary conditions, though flexibility has been built in for molecules and other
materials.

The core modules are in the (yes, you guess it) pymatgen.core package.  Given the importance of this package for the overall functioning of the code, we have provided a quick summary of the various modules here:

1. pymatgen.core.periodic_table : Everything begins here, where the Element and Specie (Element with an oxidation state) objects are defined.  Unlike typical implementations, pymatgen's Element object is rich, which means that each Element contains many useful properties associated with it, including atomic numbers, atomic masses, melting points, boiling points, just to name a few. 

2. pymatgen.core.lattice : This module defines a Lattice object, which essentially defines the lattice vectors in three dimensions. The Lattice object provides convenience methods for performing fractional to cartesian coordinates and vice version, lattice parameter and angles computations, etc.
 
3. pymatgen.core.structure : Defines the Site, PeriodicSite, Structure and Composition objects. A Site is essentially a coordinate point containing an Element or Specie. A PeriodicSite contains a Lattice as well. A Structure is simply a list of Sites having the same Lattice. Finally, a Composition is mapping of Element/Specie to amounts.

Creating Structures
===================

For most applications, you will be creating and manipulating Structure objects. There are several ways to create these objects:

Creating a Structure manually
-----------------------------

This is generally the most painful method. Though sometimes necessary, it is seldom the method you would use.  An example of creating the basic silicon crystal is provided below:

::

   si = Element("Si")
   coords = list()
   coords.append([0,0,0])
   coords.append([0.75,0.5,0.75])
   lattice = Lattice.from_parameters(a = 3.84, b = 3.84, c = 3.84, alpha = 120, beta = 90, gamma = 60)
   struct = Structure(lattice, [si, si], coords)


Creating Structures using the pymatgen.io packages
--------------------------------------------------

More often, you would already have the Structure that you want in a Crystallographic Information Format (CIF) file or from VASP input and output files. 

Pymatgen provides convenient packages to parse such files to obtain a Structure as well as other information associated with these files.

For example, to create a Structure from a cif,

::

   from pymatgen.io.cifio import CifParser
   parser = CifParser("mycif.cif")
   structure = parser.get_structures()[0]

Another example, creating a Structure from a VASP POSCAR/CONTCAR file.

::

   from pymatgen.io.vaspio import Poscar
   poscar = Poscar.from_file("POSCAR")
   struct = poscar.struct

Many of these io packages also provide the means to write a Structure to various output formats, e.g. the CifWriter in pymatgen.io.cifio. In particular, the
pymatgen.io.vaspio_set provides a powerful way to generate complete sets of VASP input files from a Structure.

Things you can do with Structures
=================================

This section is a work in progress.  But just to give an overview of the kind of analysis you can do:

1. Modify Structures using either pymatgen.core.structure_modifier, or even better, using the pymatgen.transformations and pymatgen.alchemy packages.
2. Analyse Structures. E.g., compute the Ewald sum using the pymatgen.analysis.ewald package, compare two structures for similarity using pymatgen.analysis.structure_fitter.


Example scripts
===============

Some example scripts have been provided in the scripts directory. In general, most file format conversions, manipulations and io can be done with a few quick lines of code. For example, to read a POSCAR and write a cif:

::

   from pymatgen.io.vaspio import Poscar
   from pymatgen.io.cifio import CifWriter

   p = Poscar.from_file('POSCAR')
   w = CifWriter(p.struct)
   w.write_file('mystructure.cif')

More examples will be added soon.
